		Hi dear Grader,
		<ul>
			<li>I added hover effects to the bar chart at the top right of this page. When you hover over each bar representing a streaming service, the bar changes its appearance.</li>
			<li>This was my first time using animations with D3.js, and it turned out to be easier than I expected. I added an animation to the pie chart, which was a fun learning experience. I also added a button so that you can rerun the animation more than once if needed.</li>
			<li>Lastly, the parallel coordinate plot was the most fun to code. It was something I had never thought about, let alone coded. It is interactive by highlighting one of the groups and seeing how members of that streaming service enjoy each of the genres listed.</li>
		</ul>
		Best and Thank you, <br>
		John
